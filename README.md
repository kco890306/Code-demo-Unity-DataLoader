A Unity C# utility for loading and processing structured game data from CSV files.


This project demonstrates how to load and parse structured game data from CSV files in a Unity project using C#.  
It includes processing of:

- monster Unit attributes (health, attack, defense, etc.)
- Status effects with stacking
- Unit spawn timing and pathing data

## Features
- Read multiple CSV sources into dictionaries
- Handle additive and multiplicative attributes
- Convert effect strings to typed enums
- Parse unit spawn checkpoints (positions, delays)
